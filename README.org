* Eclipse workspace containing test projects.

All eclipse projects are m2e projects.  The =pom.xml= in this
directory is the parent POM of the projects' POMs, but isn't handled
by eclipse (because it would have to become a project in its own right
and that would then conflict with having the =.git= directory in the
parent directory).

** testdatagenerator

A project for generating JSON test objects.
** elastisearchtest

The purpose of this project is to test the [[http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/java-api/][Java API of the
